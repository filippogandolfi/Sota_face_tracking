# Sota Face Tracking
Robotics Engineering Group Project

This project tries to improve these social soft skills of
Sota, an interactive robot designed for multiple applications
focused on personal assistant. It has a human-friendly look,
with funny humanoids eyes, so it is a perfect subject for
starting a human-robot interaction. Our goal is to improve
the communication with a face tracking process combined
with an as natural as possible movement of Sota’s head, in
order to give to the user the feeling of a social interaction
and so help the engagement between them.
We started our work defining a use case to identify, clarify
and organize our project requirements. The original scenario
that we thought for the interaction between Sota and a user
can be described as follows: when the user enters inside the
room, Sota starts searching for his face with a predefined
motion of the head. Then, when the user is found, Sota turns
his eyes’ color to blue, to notify that the process is started,
and it waves hello. After that it starts tracking the users face
until he is in the room. When the user exits from the room
Sota stops the tracking process and makes its eyes blinking
in red. This scenario has some necessary preconditions: we
assume that only one person at a time can be inside the room
and that we have another external system who recognizes
when the user enters and exits from the room.
